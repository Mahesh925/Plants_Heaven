    <h1>Plant Disease Information: Orange Haunglongbing (Citrus Greening)</h1>
    
    <h2>Disease Scientific Name:</h2>
    <p>Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus</p>

    <h2>Disease Name:</h2>
    <p>Orange Haunglongbing (Citrus Greening)</p>

    <h2>Disease Description:</h2>
    <p>
    
Orange Haunglongbing, also known as Citrus Greening, is a devastating bacterial disease affecting citrus trees, including orange trees. It is caused by the bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus and poses a severe threat to citrus production worldwide. Understanding its symptoms, transmission, prevention, and management is critical for citrus growers.

    </p>

    <h2>Disease Symptoms:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>- **Yellow Shoots and Leaves**: One of the early symptoms is the development of yellow shoots and leaves, often referred to as "yellow dragon" in the canopy.</li><li>- **Misshapen Fruit**: Infected trees produce small, misshapen, and bitter-tasting fruit with an uneven coloration.</li><li>- **Dieback**: Citrus Greening can cause dieback of branches and entire trees.</li><li>- **Stunted Growth**: Trees affected by the disease exhibit stunted growth and reduced fruit yield.</li><li>- **Psyllid Insect Vectors**: The Asian citrus psyllid is the primary vector responsible for transmitting the bacterium from tree to tree.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disease Transmission:</h2>
    <p>
    
- **Asian Citrus Psyllid**: The disease is primarily spread by the Asian citrus psyllid. When feeding on infected citrus trees, the psyllid acquires the bacterium and can transmit it to healthy trees during subsequent feeding.

- **Movement of Infected Trees**: The movement of infected trees or plant material can also contribute to disease spread.

- **Prevention**: Effective management of the psyllid population and prompt removal of infected trees are key preventative measures.

    </p>

    <h2>Disease Prevention:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Preventing the spread of Orange Haunglongbing (Citrus Greening) involves the following strategies:</li><li>- **Psyllid Control**: Implement a comprehensive psyllid control program using insecticides and biological control agents.</li><li>- **Tree Removal**: Remove and destroy infected citrus trees to prevent further spread of the disease.</li><li>- **Plant Certification**: Ensure that citrus trees used for planting are certified disease-free.</li><li>- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor citrus trees for symptoms and psyllid infestations.</li><li>- **Rootstock Selection**: Use disease-resistant rootstocks when grafting new citrus trees.</li><li>- **Quarantine Measures**: Implement quarantine measures to restrict the movement of citrus plant material from disease-affected areas.</li><li>Preventing Citrus Greening is critical for the sustainability of citrus production.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disease Management:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Management of Orange Haunglongbing (Citrus Greening) is challenging but essential for preserving citrus trees:</li><li>- **Psyllid Control**: Implement a rigorous psyllid control program to reduce the vector's population.</li><li>- **Tree Removal**: Promptly remove and destroy infected trees to prevent further disease spread.</li><li>- **Nutritional Support**: Provide infected trees with proper nutrition to support their overall health.</li><li>- **Resistant Varieties**: Research and develop citrus varieties with resistance to the disease.</li><li>- **Research**: Invest in research to develop new management strategies and control measures.</li><li>- **Public Awareness**: Educate citrus growers and the public about the importance of early detection and disease management.</li><li>Effective management requires a multidisciplinary approach and collaboration among citrus growers, researchers, and regulatory agencies.</li>
    </ul>
