    <h1>Plant Disease Information:  Corn Cercospora Leaf Spot / Gray Leaf Spot</h1>
    
    <h2>Disease Scientific Name:</h2>
    <p>Cercospora zeae-maydis</p>

    <h2>Disease Name:</h2>
    <p> Corn Cercospora Leaf Spot / Gray Leaf Spot</p>

    <h2>Disease Description:</h2>
    <p>
    
Cercospora Leaf Spot, also known as Gray Leaf Spot, is a fungal disease that affects corn (maize) plants. It can reduce crop yield and quality if not managed effectively. Understanding the characteristics, symptoms, transmission, prevention, and management of Cercospora Leaf Spot is essential for corn growers.

    </p>

    <h2>Disease Symptoms:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cercospora Leaf Spot / Gray Leaf Spot exhibits the following symptoms:</li><li>Leaf Lesions: The disease begins with the development of small, oval to elongated lesions on corn leaves. These lesions have a gray to tan center with a dark brown to purplish border.</li><li>Leaf Blighting: Lesions can expand, causing extensive blighting of leaves, which can lead to reduced photosynthesis and yield loss.</li><li>Stalk Infection: In severe cases, the disease can progress to affect corn stalks, potentially leading to lodging.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disease Transmission:</h2>
    <p>
    
Preventing Cercospora Leaf Spot / Gray Leaf Spot includes the following strategies:

Resistant Varieties: Plant corn varieties that are resistant or less susceptible to the disease.

Crop Rotation: Rotate corn with non-host crops to reduce the buildup of inoculum in the soil.

Fungicides: In severe cases, fungicides may be applied preventively.

    </p>

    <h2>Disease Prevention:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Preventing Cercospora Leaf Spot / Gray Leaf Spot includes the following strategies:</li><li>Resistant Varieties: Plant corn varieties that are resistant or less susceptible to the disease.</li><li>Crop Rotation: Rotate corn with non-host crops to reduce the buildup of inoculum in the soil.</li><li>Fungicides: In severe cases, fungicides may be applied preventively.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disease Management:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Effective management of Cercospora Leaf Spot / Gray Leaf Spot involves:</li><li>Fungicide Applications: In commercial corn production, fungicides are commonly used to manage the disease. Application timing is critical for effectiveness.</li><li>Crop Monitoring: Regularly scout corn fields for symptoms and initiate control measures when necessary.</li><li>Cultural Practices: Implement good agricultural practices, including proper spacing, irrigation management, and residue management, to reduce disease pressure.</li>
    </ul>
