    <h1>Plant Disease Information</h1>
    <h2>Disease Scientific Name:</h2>
    <p>Tomato Mosaic Virus</p>

<h2>Disease Name:</h2>
<p>Tomato Mosaic Virus (ToMV)</p>

<h2>Disease Description:</h2>
<p>The Tomato Mosaic Virus, or ToMV, is a highly contagious viral disease that primarily affects tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum). It is a member of the Tobamovirus genus and is known for causing significant damage to tomato crops worldwide. ToMV can lead to reduced yields and poor fruit quality, making it a major concern for tomato growers.</p>

<h2>Disease Symptoms:</h2>
<p>Tomato plants infected with the Tomato Mosaic Virus typically display the following symptoms:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Mosaic-like patterns of light and dark green on the leaves, giving them a mottled appearance.</li>
    <li>Leaf distortion and curling.</li>
    <li>Stunted growth, particularly in young plants.</li>
    <li>Reduced fruit production and quality, with fruits often showing discoloration and irregular shapes.</li>
    <li>Yellow streaks or rings on the fruit skin.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disease Transmission:</h2>
<p>ToMV is primarily transmitted through direct contact with infected plant material. The virus can survive for extended periods on contaminated gardening tools, hands, and clothing. It can also be transmitted through contaminated soil, seeds, and by sap-feeding insects, such as aphids and whiteflies. Therefore, it's essential to practice good sanitation and hygiene to prevent the spread of the virus.</p>

<h2>Disease Prevention:</h2>
<p>Preventing the Tomato Mosaic Virus is crucial for maintaining healthy tomato crops. Here are some preventive measures:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Start with disease-free seeds and plants from reputable sources.</li>
    <li>Practice good hygiene by washing hands and tools thoroughly when handling tomato plants.</li>
    <li>Use insecticides to control aphids and whiteflies, which can transmit the virus.</li>
    <li>Rotate tomato crops to different areas of the garden each season to reduce the risk of virus build-up in the soil.</li>
    <li>Remove and destroy infected plants immediately to prevent further spread.</li>
    <li>Avoid planting tomatoes near tobacco or other solanaceous plants, as they can host the virus.</li>
    <li>Consider using resistant tomato varieties if available.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disease Management:</h2>
<p>If your tomato plants become infected with ToMV, it's essential to take prompt action to manage the disease:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Isolate infected plants to prevent the virus from spreading to healthy ones.</li>
    <li>Prune and remove infected plant parts, including leaves and fruits.</li>
    <li>Apply fungicides as recommended by local agricultural extension services or experts.</li>
    <li>Monitor your garden regularly for signs of the disease, and be vigilant in removing and disposing of infected material promptly.</li>
    <li>Continue practicing good hygiene and sanitation to prevent further outbreaks.</li>
</ul>

<p>By following these guidelines for prevention and management, you can reduce the impact of Tomato Mosaic Virus on your tomato plants and help ensure a healthier harvest.</p>
