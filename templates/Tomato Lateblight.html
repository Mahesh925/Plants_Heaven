    <h1>Plant Disease Information</h1>
    <h2>Disease Scientific Name:</h2>
    <p>Phytophthora infestans</p>

    <h2>Disease Name:</h2>
    <p>Late Blight</p>

    <h2>Disease Origin:</h2>
    <p>Late blight, caused by Phytophthora infestans, is believed to have originated in South America, particularly in the Andes region. It was first documented in Europe during the mid-19th century and is infamous for its role in the Irish potato famine, which led to widespread suffering and death due to crop failures. The disease spreads rapidly under favorable conditions, making it a significant threat to tomato and potato crops worldwide.</p>

    <h2>Disease Symptoms:</h2>
    <p>Late blight symptoms include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dark, water-soaked lesions on leaves, stems, and fruit.</li>
        <li>Fuzzy, white mold growth on the undersides of infected leaves.</li>
        <li>Green to brownish-black spots on tomatoes, often with a bullseye-like appearance.</li>
        <li>Rapid wilting and death of plant tissue.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disease Prevention:</h2>
    <p>To prevent late blight and protect your tomato plants, follow these comprehensive measures:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Plant disease-resistant tomato varieties, which are less susceptible to late blight.</li>
        <li>Space tomato plants adequately (at least 2-3 feet apart) to ensure good air circulation, reducing humidity around the plants.</li>
        <li>Avoid overhead watering, as wet foliage promotes disease development. Instead, use drip irrigation or water at the base of the plants.</li>
        <li>Apply fungicides preventatively, especially in regions with a history of late blight outbreaks. Copper-based fungicides are commonly used for organic control.</li>
        <li>Regularly inspect your tomato plants for early signs of late blight, such as dark spots on leaves, and remove any infected leaves immediately to limit the spread of the disease.</li>
        <li>Remove and destroy infected plant material away from the garden, ensuring that spores do not contaminate healthy plants.</li>
        <li>Rotate crops in subsequent seasons to reduce the risk of late blight recurrence in the same location.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disease Solution:</h2>
    <p>If late blight is detected in your tomato plants, take immediate action to prevent further damage:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove and destroy all infected plants and plant parts to prevent the spread of spores.</li>
        <li>Apply copper-based fungicides early in the season as a preventive measure, especially if late blight has been a problem in your area in previous years.</li>
        <li>Rotate crops to different areas of your garden each year, as the late blight pathogen can persist in the soil.</li>
        <li>Monitor your garden regularly for signs of the disease, and be vigilant in removing and disposing of infected material promptly.</li>
    </ul>
