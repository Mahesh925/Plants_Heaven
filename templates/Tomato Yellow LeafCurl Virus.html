    <h1>Plant Disease Information</h1>
    
    <h2>Disease Scientific Name:</h2>
    <p>Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus</p>

    <h2>Disease Name:</h2>
    <p>Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV)</p>

    <h2>Disease Description:</h2>
    <p>The Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus, or TYLCV, is a devastating viral disease that primarily affects tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum). It belongs to the genus Begomovirus and is known for causing severe damage to tomato crops worldwide. TYLCV can result in reduced yields, deformed fruits, and stunted plant growth, posing a significant threat to tomato growers.</p>

    <h2>Disease Symptoms:</h2>
    <p>Tomato plants infected with the Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus typically exhibit the following symptoms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Yellowing and upward curling of the leaves, especially on the upper part of the plant.</li>
        <li>Leaf distortion and reduced leaf size.</li>
        <li>Stunted growth, particularly in young plants.</li>
        <li>Reduced fruit production and quality, with fruits often being small and malformed.</li>
        <li>Yellow streaks or curling of the leaf veins.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disease Transmission:</h2>
    <p>TYLCV is primarily transmitted by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci. Infected whiteflies feed on tomato plants and transmit the virus from plant to plant. The virus can also be spread through contaminated plant material, tools, and equipment. Preventing whitefly infestations is crucial in controlling the spread of TYLCV.</p>

    <h2>Disease Prevention:</h2>
    <p>Preventing Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus is essential for safeguarding tomato crops. Here are some preventive measures:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use insecticides to control whiteflies and other potential vectors of the virus.</li>
        <li>Plant virus-resistant tomato varieties when available.</li>
        <li>Remove and destroy infected plants immediately to prevent further spread.</li>
        <li>Avoid planting tomatoes near other susceptible crops, as the virus can affect other Solanaceae family members.</li>
        <li>Use physical barriers like row covers to protect young plants from whitefly infestations.</li>
        <li>Practice good garden hygiene, including cleaning tools and equipment to prevent virus transmission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disease Management:</h2>
    <p>If your tomato plants become infected with TYLCV, it's crucial to take prompt action to manage the disease:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Isolate infected plants to prevent the virus from spreading to healthy ones.</li>
        <li>Prune and remove infected plant parts, including severely affected leaves and fruits.</li>
        <li>Apply insecticides or neem oil to control whitefly populations.</li>
        <li>Monitor your garden regularly for signs of the disease, and promptly remove and dispose of infected material.</li>
        <li>Consider using reflective mulch to deter whiteflies from landing on tomato plants.</li>
    </ul>
