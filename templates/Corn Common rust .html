    <h1>Plant Disease Information:  Corn (maize) - Common Rust</h1>
    
    <h2>Disease Scientific Name:</h2>
    <p>Cercospora zeae-maydis</p>

    <h2>Disease Name:</h2>
    <p> Corn (maize) - Common Rust</p>

    <h2>Disease Description:</h2>
    <p>
    
Common Rust is a fungal disease that affects corn (maize) plants. It is a common foliar disease that can reduce yield and overall crop quality if not managed. Understanding the characteristics, symptoms, transmission, prevention, and management of Common Rust is crucial for corn growers.

    </p>

    <h2>Disease Symptoms:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Common Rust exhibits the following symptoms:</li><li>Small Pustules: The most characteristic symptom is the development of small, round to elongated pustules on the leaves, typically on the upper surface. These pustules are rusty brown to reddish-brown in color.</li><li>Leaf Discoloration: Infected leaves may show yellow or chlorotic streaking between the pustules.</li><li>Reduced Photosynthesis: Severe infections can reduce photosynthesis, leading to yield loss.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disease Transmission:</h2>
    <p>
    
Common Rust is primarily spread through airborne spores. Common transmission routes include:

Wind Dissemination: Wind carries fungal spores from infected corn plants to healthy ones.

    </p>

    <h2>Disease Prevention:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Preventing Common Rust includes the following strategies:</li><li>Resistant Varieties: Plant corn varieties that are resistant or less susceptible to Common Rust.</li><li>Crop Rotation: Rotate corn with non-host crops to reduce the buildup of inoculum in the soil.</li><li>Fungicides: In severe cases, fungicides may be applied preventively.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disease Management:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Effective management of Common Rust involves:</li><li>Fungicide Applications: In commercial corn production, fungicides are sometimes used to manage the disease. Application timing is critical for effectiveness.</li><li>Crop Monitoring: Regularly scout corn fields for symptoms and initiate control measures when necessary.</li><li>Cultural Practices: Implement good agricultural practices, including proper spacing, irrigation management, and residue management, to reduce disease pressure.</li>
    </ul>
