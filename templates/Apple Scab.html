    <h1>Plant Disease Information: Apple Scab</h1>
    
    <h2>Disease Scientific Name:</h2>
    <p>Venturia inaequalis</p>

    <h2>Disease Name:</h2>
    <p>Apple Scab</p>

    <h2>Disease Description:</h2>
    <p>
    Apple Scab, caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis, is a prevalent and economically significant disease 
    affecting apple trees (Malus domestica) worldwide. It primarily targets leaves and fruits, leading to 
    reduced fruit quality and yield if left unmanaged. Understanding this disease's characteristics, symptoms, 
    transmission, prevention strategies, and management techniques is crucial for apple orchard health.
    </p>

    <h2>Disease Symptoms:</h2>
    <p>
    - Leaves: Small, olive-green to black lesions initially appear on the upper surface of apple tree leaves. 
    These lesions may have a velvety texture and can enlarge into scaly, distinct areas. Severely affected leaves 
    may curl, wither, and drop prematurely.
    
    - Fruits: Early infections result in small, scab-like lesions on the fruit surface, which become more 
    pronounced as the fruit matures. These lesions can turn into raised, corky, and blackened scabs, 
    potentially distorting the fruit's shape.
    </p>

    <h2>Disease Transmission:</h2>
    <p>
    Apple Scab primarily spreads through asexual spores known as conidia. Common transmission methods include:
    
    - Rain Splash: Raindrops dislodge conidia from infected leaves or fruit, carrying them to healthy plant 
    parts. This transmission is especially effective during wet and humid conditions.
    
    - Wind Dissemination: Wind can carry conidia to nearby apple trees, initiating new infections.
    
    - Infected Debris: Fallen leaves and fruit with overwintering fungal structures (pseudothecia) can serve 
    as a source of primary infection in the spring when they release ascospores.
    </p>

    <h2>Disease Prevention:</h2>
    <p>
    Effective prevention strategies for Apple Scab include:
    
    - Sanitation: Remove and destroy fallen leaves and fruit to reduce overwintering fungal structures.
    
    - Pruning: Enhance air circulation and reduce humidity in the canopy through proper pruning.
    
    - Resistant Varieties: Consider planting apple tree varieties with natural resistance to Apple Scab.
    
    - Fungicide Applications: Apply fungicides according to a schedule during periods of high disease pressure.
    
    - Biological Control: Use beneficial microorganisms to inhibit the growth of Apple Scab-causing fungi.
    
    - Monitoring: Regularly inspect trees for early signs of the disease.
    </p>

    <h2>Disease Management:</h2>
    <p>
    Effective management of Apple Scab involves:
    
    - Fungicide Applications: Use fungicides in commercial orchards to prevent and manage Apple Scab.
    
    - Pruning and Canopy Management: Improve air circulation and reduce humidity in the canopy.
    
    - Biological Control: Consider using beneficial fungi and bacteria to suppress the disease.
    
    - Resistant Varieties: Plant apple varieties with known resistance.
    
    - Regular Monitoring: Detect symptoms early to initiate timely actions, such as fungicide application.
    
    - Weather Forecasting: Anticipate disease pressure periods using weather forecasts.
    
    - Integrated Pest Management (IPM): Combine multiple strategies for effective disease management.
