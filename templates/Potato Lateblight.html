    <h1>Plant Disease Information: Potato Late Blight</h1>
    
    <h2>Disease Scientific Name:</h2>
    <p>Phytophthora infestans</p>

    <h2>Disease Name:</h2>
    <p>Potato Late Blight</p>

    <h2>Disease Description:</h2>
    <p>Potato Late Blight, caused by the pathogen Phytophthora infestans, is a devastating disease that primarily affects potato plants. This fungal-like microorganism thrives in cool, moist conditions and can rapidly spread, leading to significant crop losses. Potato Late Blight is infamous for its role in the Irish Potato Famine in the 19th century.</p>

    <h2>Disease Symptoms:</h2>
    <p>Tomato plants infected with Potato Late Blight exhibit several distinct symptoms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Foliage Lesions: The disease first manifests as dark, water-soaked lesions on the foliage, often with a fuzzy or moldy appearance on the undersides of the leaves.</li>
        <li>Leaf Yellowing and Wilting: Infected leaves turn yellow and wilt, leading to rapid defoliation.</li>
        <li>Stem and Tubers: The pathogen can also affect potato stems and tubers, causing brown, rotting lesions that render the tubers inedible and unmarketable.</li>
        <li>White Mold: In humid conditions, a white, cottony mold may develop on infected plant parts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disease Transmission:</h2>
    <p>Potato Late Blight is primarily spread through spores that are carried by wind, rain, or water splashes. The pathogen can also survive in infected plant debris, soil, or on equipment. To prevent transmission, it is essential to practice good sanitation, avoid planting infected seed potatoes, and take measures to reduce humidity around plants.</p>

    <h2>Disease Prevention:</h2>
    <p>Preventing Potato Late Blight is crucial for potato crop health. Here are some preventive measures:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Resistant Varieties: Plant potato varieties that are resistant to late blight if they are available and suitable for your region.</li>
        <li>Crop Rotation: Avoid planting potatoes or other susceptible crops in the same area for several years to break the disease cycle.</li>
        <li>Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plant material, including leaves and tubers. Practice strict sanitation in your garden and disinfect equipment.</li>
        <li>Monitor Weather: Be vigilant during cool, wet weather conditions, which are conducive to late blight development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disease Management:</h2>
    <p>If Potato Late Blight is detected in your potato crop, take immediate action to manage the disease:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove Infected Plant Parts: Prune and remove infected foliage and stems. Bag and dispose of the infected material away from the garden.</li>
        <li>Fungicide Application: Apply fungicides specifically labeled for late blight control. Follow recommended guidelines and schedules.</li>
        <li>Reduce Humidity: Use measures such as proper spacing, drip irrigation, and adequate ventilation to reduce humidity around potato plants.</li>
        <li>Isolate Infected Plants: Isolate infected plants to prevent the disease from spreading to healthy ones.</li>
    </ul>
