    <h1>Plant Disease Information: Strawberry Leaf Scorch</h1>

    <h2>Disease Scientific Name:</h2>
    <p>Xanthomonas fragariae</p>

    <h2>Disease Name:</h2>
    <p>Strawberry Leaf Scorch</p>

    <h2>Disease Description:</h2>
    <p>Strawberry Leaf Scorch is a common disease affecting strawberry plants. It is caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas fragariae and is characterized by the appearance of small, dark lesions on strawberry leaves. These lesions often have a water-soaked appearance and can lead to reduced plant vigor and fruit production. The disease is more prevalent in areas with high humidity and warm temperatures.</p>

    <h2>Disease Symptoms:</h2>
    <p>Strawberry plants infected with Leaf Scorch display several distinctive symptoms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Leaf Lesions: The disease causes circular or irregularly shaped lesions on strawberry leaves. These lesions are initially small and dark, with a water-soaked appearance.</li>
        <li>Leaf Yellowing: Infected leaves may exhibit yellowing, especially around the lesions, and can eventually lead to leaf necrosis.</li>
        <li>Reduced Fruit Quality: As the disease progresses, it can lead to reduced fruit quality and yield.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disease Transmission:</h2>
    <p>Strawberry Leaf Scorch is primarily transmitted through water, either through splashing rain or irrigation. The bacterium can also be introduced into the garden through infected plant material or contaminated tools. To prevent transmission, it's essential to practice good sanitation and avoid overhead watering.</p>

    <h2>Disease Prevention:</h2>
    <p>Preventing Strawberry Leaf Scorch is crucial for maintaining healthy strawberry plants. Here are some preventive measures:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Variety Selection: Choose strawberry varieties that are resistant to Leaf Scorch if available in your region.</li>
        <li>Sanitation: Regularly clean and disinfect gardening tools to prevent the spread of the bacterium. Remove and destroy any infected plant material.</li>
        <li>Proper Watering: Avoid overhead watering and use drip irrigation or soaker hoses to keep the foliage dry.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disease Management:</h2>
    <p>If you suspect Strawberry Leaf Scorch in your strawberry plants, take immediate action to manage the disease:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Prune Affected Leaves: Remove and destroy leaves with lesions to reduce the disease's spread.</li>
        <li>Copper-Based Sprays: Apply copper-based bactericides as recommended by local agricultural experts to control the disease.</li>
        <li>Isolation: Isolate infected plants to prevent further spread within the garden.</li>
        <li>Regular Monitoring: Keep a close eye on your strawberry plants and address new infections promptly.</li>
    </ul>
