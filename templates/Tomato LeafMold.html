    <h1>Plant Disease Information: Tomato Leaf Mold</h1>
    
    <h2>Disease Scientific Name:</h2>
    <p>Passalora fulva</p>

    <h2>Disease Name:</h2>
    <p>Tomato Leaf Mold</p>

    <h2>Disease Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Tomato plants suffering from Leaf Mold, caused by the fungus Passalora fulva, often display distinctive symptoms. This disease primarily affects the foliage of tomato plants, leading to the development of characteristic yellowish-green to brownish patches on the leaves. These patches are often surrounded by a narrow yellow halo, giving them a unique appearance.

        As Leaf Mold progresses, affected leaves may become twisted or distorted, and a fuzzy or velvety growth, containing spores, may appear on the undersides of the leaves. This fungal disease can lead to a reduction in photosynthesis, affecting the overall health and yield of tomato plants.

        Managing Tomato Leaf Mold involves a combination of cultural practices and, in severe cases, the use of fungicides. Proper spacing between plants, adequate ventilation, and avoiding overhead watering can help reduce the risk of infection.
    </p>

    <h2>Disease Symptoms:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Yellowish-green to brownish patches on tomato leaves.</li>
        <li>Narrow yellow halo around affected areas.</li>
        <li>Twisted or distorted leaves.</li>
        <li>Fuzzy or velvety growth on the undersides of leaves.</li>
        <li>Reduced photosynthesis and overall plant health.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disease Transmission:</h2>
    <p>
        Tomato Leaf Mold is primarily spread through the air via spores produced on infected plant tissues. Rainfall, high humidity, and the presence of free water on leaves can promote spore production and disease development. It's essential to avoid overhead irrigation and provide adequate plant spacing and ventilation to reduce the risk of infection.
    </p>

    <h2>Disease Prevention:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Proper plant spacing to improve air circulation.</li>
        <li>Avoiding overhead irrigation and watering at the base of plants.</li>
        <li>Regularly inspecting plants for early signs of Leaf Mold.</li>
        <li>Promptly removing and disposing of infected leaves and plant debris.</li>
        <li>Applying fungicides as recommended in severe cases.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disease Management:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Practicing good garden hygiene by removing and destroying infected plant material.</li>
        <li>Providing adequate ventilation by spacing plants appropriately.</li>
        <li>Monitoring for signs of Leaf Mold and taking action when detected.</li>
        <li>Using fungicides according to recommended guidelines in severe infestations.</li>
        <li>Regularly assessing and maintaining overall plant health.</li>
    </ul>
