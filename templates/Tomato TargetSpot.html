    <h1>Plant Disease Information</h1>
    
    <h2>Disease Scientific Name:</h2>
    <p>Target Spot</p>

    <h2>Disease Name:</h2>
    <p>Target Spot on Tomato</p>

    <h2>Disease Description:</h2>
    <p>Target spot, also known as Corynespora leaf spot, is a common fungal disease that affects tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum). It is caused by the fungus Corynespora cassiicola. Target spot is a significant concern for tomato growers as it can lead to reduced crop yields and affect the overall health of the plants.</p>

    <h2>Disease Symptoms:</h2>
    <p>Tomato plants infected with target spot typically display the following symptoms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Small, circular lesions with concentric rings on the leaves, resembling a target.</li>
        <li>Yellowing of the areas surrounding the lesions.</li>
        <li>Leaf wilting and defoliation, especially in severe infections.</li>
        <li>Reduced fruit production and quality, with fruit lesions appearing as dark, sunken spots.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disease Transmission:</h2>
    <p>Target spot is primarily spread through water splashes, rain, and wind. The fungal spores can survive on infected plant debris, in the soil, and on garden tools. It's essential to minimize moisture on the leaves and practice good garden hygiene to prevent the spread of this disease.</p>

    <h2>Disease Prevention:</h2>
    <p>Preventing target spot is essential for maintaining healthy tomato crops. Here are some preventive measures:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Start with disease-free seeds and plants from reputable sources.</li>
        <li>Avoid overhead watering to reduce moisture on leaves.</li>
        <li>Use mulch to prevent soil from splashing onto the leaves.</li>
        <li>Space plants adequately for good air circulation.</li>
        <li>Remove and destroy infected plants and debris promptly to prevent further spread.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disease Management:</h2>
    <p>If your tomato plants become infected with target spot, it's essential to take prompt action to manage the disease:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Isolate infected plants to prevent the disease from spreading.</li>
        <li>Prune and remove infected plant parts, including leaves and fruit.</li>
        <li>Apply fungicides as recommended by local agricultural extension services or experts.</li>
        <li>Continue practicing good garden hygiene to prevent further outbreaks.</li>
    </ul>
